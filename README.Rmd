# Quick guide

Once you have cloned the repository to your computer, open the project and run:

devtools::install()

This will install the package to your local library.

The data to use for the dashboard is:

data("dungfauna_aus")

These data contain records from DBEE, QLD and a WA project. Not for public release just yet.

There will be some further refinements to these data but I think we are at a stage to include a dashboard in the package.

So, the aim is to:

- 1. incorporate a copy of the dashboard into the package so that when a user installs the package they can run the dashboard locally.

- 2. update the dashboard so that it includes 

* all species found in the scientificName column (there are now new species from the QLD and WA projects that will need to be added to the 'Select a species' menu)

* A new menu item allowing for data to be filtered by datasetName (i.e. project)

* Remove the prediction tab

* Put back in the data tab

* Turn off the jittering of points

* Any other minor changes we think of

**Note: this is not a replacement of the existing dashboard but a copy.**

The goal of dungfaunaR is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of dungfaunaR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jdberson/dungfaunaR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(dungfaunaR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
